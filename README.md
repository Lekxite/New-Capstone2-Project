# Project Title: Nigeria COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python
# Introduction:
```python
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major 
parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first
case on 27th February 2020.
Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 
200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case 
to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.
The major aim of writing this report is to evaluate the negative impact of covid-19 on Nigeria's economy and how the country
managed to survive it.

# Analysis Questions:
```python
Generate a plot that shows the Top 10 states in terms of Confirmed Covid cases by Laboratory test.
Generate a plot that shows the Top 10 states in terms of Discharged Covid cases. Hint - Sort the values.
Plot the top 10 Death cases.
Generate a line plot for the total daily confirmed, recovered and death cases in Nigeria.
Determine the daily infection rate, you can use the Pandas diff method to find the derivate of the total cases.
Generate a line plot for the above.
Calculate maximum infection rate for a day (Number of new cases).
Find the date.
Determine the relationship between the external dataset(overall community vulnerability index) and the NCDC COVID-19 dataset.
Determine the relationship between the external dataset and the NCDC COVID-19 dataset(Confirmed Cases and Population Density).
Provide a summary of your observation.
Determine the effect of the Pandemic on the economy. To do this, you will compare the Real GDP value Pre-COVID-19 
with Real GDP in 2020 (COVID-19 Period, especially Q2 2020.
